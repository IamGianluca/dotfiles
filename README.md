# Installation

To install my dotfiles, please run the following command in your terminal.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:IamGianluca/dotfiles.git .dotfiles && cd .dotfiles && ./install
```

This will take care of automatically generate the necessary folders and symlinks to get you started.

A companion [repository](https://github.com/IamGianluca/ansible/tree/main) exists to install all dependencies needed to replicate my OS.
